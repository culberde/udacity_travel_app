# Starting New Projects with Webpack

Use this as a starting point for any projects you are going to build with Webpack. Below are step by step instructions for setting up the environment. These instructions assume you have already installed `node.js` as well as `express`, `cors`, and `body-parser`.

## Set Up Instructions

1. Create a new project directory and download all folders and files to the new directory.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the new directory you just created (using cd). Install the following packages:
    * Webpack and webpack-cli: `npm i webpack webpack-cli`
    * Babel loader: `npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader`
    * HTML plugin: `npm i -D html-webpack-plugin`
    * Webpack dev server: `npm i -D webpack-dev-server`
    * Clean plugin: `npm i -D clean-webpack-plugin`
    * CSS and Sass loaders: `npm i -D style-loader node-sass css-loader sass-loader`
    * Mini CSS plugin: `npm i -D mini-css-extract-plugin`
    * Optimize CSS and Terser plugins: `npm i -D optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin terser-webpack-plugin`
